I attended the <a href="https://deeplearningindaba.com/2024/" target="_blank">2024 iteration </a> of the Deep Learning Indaba in Dakar, Senegal. Here, I had the opportunity to present a tutorial that covered the basics of Federated Learning that I wrote in collaboration with <a href="https://nelaturuharsha.github.io/" target="_blank">Harsha</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luca-powell/?originalSubdomain=za" target="_blank">luca</a>. If you are interested in seeing this tutorial, you can find the resources <a href="https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2024/tree/main/practicals/Federated_Learning" target="_blank">here</a>. Please also check out the other practicals; there was a lot of effort put in to create some great resources.
