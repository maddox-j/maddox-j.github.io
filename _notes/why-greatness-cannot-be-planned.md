title: why greatness cannot be planned
description: 
---
I had the wonderful opportunity to be invited as a guest speaker at the inaugural seminar at the University of Cape Town AI Society. I shared my thoughts on the pursuit of novelty and creativity, and its link to education, heavily inspired by the works of Kenneth Stanley<sup>*</sup> , Joel Lehman<sup>*</sup> and the late Sir Ken Robinson.

<sup>*</sup> The title of the work is inspired by KS & JL's book "Why Greatness Cannot be Planned: The Myth of Objective".
