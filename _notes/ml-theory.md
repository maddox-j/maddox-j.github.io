title: ml theory at cohere labs.

At the [Cohere Labs open-science community](https://cohere.com/research/open-science){:target="_blank"}, I have the privilege of being of one the co-leads for the ML Theory group. We manage this group as we believe that: 
> The world of machine learning is incredibly broad, and there are no signs of this slowing down anytime soon. In order to understand the literature, one needs to build up a sound set of theoretical knowledge so that we can sift through claims which claim to be true, but are false, to identify true nuggets of information that will guide progress in the next coming years.

> This community is intended to be an informal platform where our intention is to go beyond the empirical results we see in papers, and attempt to ask: why was this the result, and not something else. We hope to create a collaborative environment (with friendly and constructive debates) which will ultimately encourage all of us to have a deeper understanding of a technology that is likely to remain here for a long time.
