Alongside my studies, I also provide private mathematics tutoring to students via Zoom. I have been tutoring for three years, teaching both HL IB Mathematics and IEB Mathematics (South Africa). If you are interested in this, please [email me](mailto:contact.me.maddox@gmail.com) to find out more details.
