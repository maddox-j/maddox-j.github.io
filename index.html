					<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
					<p>I am a fourth-year artificial intelligence and computer science student at the University of Edinburgh. I am an analytical, curious and dedicated worker who is ready to integrate his optimistic outlook into any team. I have an interest in how data analysis can be used to solve pressing global issues. I am looking to gain practical experience in the dynamic and expanding field of computer science to compliment my current knowledge and to extend my capabilities as a professional.</p>

						<ul>
						<li><h3>RecyclEd - Python</h3>
							<p> 
								RecyclEd is a reverse recycling machine that takes recyclable items from users and classifies them according to their object category (plastic bottle, glass bottle, metal can, or rubbish). Object classification is performed using a residual neural network. If the object is classified as recycling, the system will move the object into the appropriate bin. Based on the items accepted, the user will be entitled to monetary compensation, given through a coupon to the user.

						<li><h3>Drone Food Delivery Service - Java</h3>
							<p>
								In this day and age, many people, including students, have their food delivered. Wouldn't it be nifty if we could create a drone that would deliver meals to precise coordinate locations?
								<br><br>
								This task of this project was to devise an algorithm that would act as cost-constrained path finder: it would plan the route that the drone would take to deliver the food orders on a given day, maximing the daily profit.

						<li><h3>The Effect of COVID-19 on the Usage of 'Just Eats Cycles' - Python</h3>
							<p>
								In a report with a coursework partner, we investigate how the usage of the bike sharing service ’Just Eat Cycles’ was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesised that users of ’Just Eat Cycles’ would use this service to visit scenic locations and to exercise, instead of commuting.<br> <br><a href="https://github.com/maddox-j/justeatscycles-covid19">See the full report on GitHub.</a>

							</p>
						</li>
						<li><h3>Arduino Audio Visualiser - C/C++</h3>
							<p>Using an ESP32 board, I connected two microphones and an OLED dislplay to the microcontroller. With these, I processed the input from the analogue microphone and 
displayed the signal on the display according to the volume intensity.</p>
