					<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
					<p>I am a fourth-year artificial intelligence and computer science student at the University of Edinburgh. I am an analytical, curious and dedicated worker who is ready to integrate his optimistic outlook into any team. I have an interest in how data analysis can be used to solve pressing global issues. I am looking to gain practical experience in the dynamic and expanding field of computer science to compliment my current knowledge and to extend my capabilities as a professional.</p>

						<li><h3>Reverse Recycling Machine - RecylEd</h3></li>
						<li><h3>Drone Food Delivery Service - Java</h3>
							<p>
								The task of this project was to plan the route that a drone will take to deliver food and drink orders on a given day. There were a number of limitations to this:<br>
								1) The drone had a limited number of moves before it ran out of battery. <br>
								2) The drone could not fly over certain predefined buildings (no-fly zone(s)).<br>
								To find the shortest route, I implemented a nearest neighbour heuristic between adjacent orders based on the straight-line distances between two potential start and destination nodes. Once this was obtained, I found potential rerouting nodes, the vertices of the bounding box for each no-fly zone, so as to avoid the obstacles. However, another limitation is the drone could only fly on a bearing that was a multiple of ten between zero and three hundred and fifty degrees. To ensure that the no-fly zones were never touched, a implemented an algorithm to apply local corrections to the current path whilst ensuring the smallest deviation from the target.

						<li><h3>The Effect of COVID-19 on the Usage of 'Just Eats Cycles' - Python</h3>
							<p>
								In a report with a coursework partner, we investigate how the usage of the bike sharing service ’Just Eat Cycles’ was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesised that users of ’Just Eat Cycles’ would use this service to visit scenic locations and to exercise, instead of commuting.<br> <br><a href="https://github.com/maddox-j/justeatscycles-covid19">See the full report on GitHub.</a>

							</p>
						</li>
						<li><h3>Arduino Audio Visualiser - C/C++</h3>
							<p>Using an ESP32 board, I connected two microphones and an OLED dislplay to the microcontroller. With these, I processed the input from the analogue microphone and 
displayed the signal on the display according to the volume intensity.</p>
